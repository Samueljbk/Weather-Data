# Project Skeleton To-Do List for Weather API

## 1. Set Up Project Environment
- [x] **Create a new GitHub repository**: Name it something like `weather-api-project`.
- [x] **Clone the repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
- [x] **Set up a virtual environment**: Use `venv` in Python to create a virtual environment.
- [x] **Activate the virtual environment**: Make sure your environment is activated for package installation.

## 2. Install Necessary Packages
- [ ] **Install Flask**: `pip install flask`
- [ ] **Install requests**: `pip install requests`
- [ ] **Install Redis and the Python Redis client**: `pip install redis`
- [ ] **Install python-dotenv**: `pip install python-dotenv` (for environment variables)
- [ ] **(Optional) Install flask-limiter**: `pip install flask-limiter` (for rate limiting)

## 3. Project Directory Structure
- [ ] **Create a main project folder**: This should include all your code and resources.
- [ ] **Inside the folder, create a file named `app.py`**: This will be your main application file.
- [ ] **Create a `.env` file**: For storing environment variables like your API key.
- [ ] **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: To list all your dependencies for easy installation.

## 4. Set Up Basic Flask API
- [ ] **Write a basic Flask app**: Create a simple route in `app.py` that returns a hardcoded JSON response.
- [ ] **Test your Flask app locally**: Make sure it runs without errors.

## 5. Set Up Redis Locally
- [ ] **Install Redis on your machine**: Follow the Redis installation guide for your operating system.
- [ ] **Start the Redis server**: Ensure Redis is running before you connect to it from Python.
- [ ] **Test Redis connection**: Use a simple Python script to check if you can connect to Redis.

## 6. Configure Environment Variables
- [ ] **Add your Visual Crossing API key to `.env`**: Use `python-dotenv` to load these variables in `app.py`.
- [ ] **Add your Redis connection details to `.env`**: Make sure your app can access these variables securely.

## Additional Steps for Error Handling and Rate Limiting
- [ ] **Plan your error handling strategy**: Make notes on how to handle API errors and invalid inputs.
- [ ] **Decide on rate limiting rules**: Configure `flask-limiter` for your API.
